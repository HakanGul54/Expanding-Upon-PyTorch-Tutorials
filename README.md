# Expanding-Upon-PyTorch-Tutorials
My adventures trying to expand upon the tutorials on pytorch website to learn and improve.

Currently, I am working on implementing a variation of NanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy for text classification. The current model has very minimal modifications but as the project gets steadier, I will implement additions and possibly simplifications depending on the task.
